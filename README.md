# 2 Idiots 1 Keyboard

A strange console rendered game with MIDI Device support

## WAT

This is a game hastly hacked together at [CampJS VI](http://vi.campjs.com/)

The concept was we had 1 MIDI keyboard between 2 of us and I was proving that I could reproduce functionality in the console that was being done int the browser.

The functionality begand as
- Get MIDI keyboard connected
- Parse MIDI message
- Make a bear dance

Once that was done I also whent ahead and made it a game, with payments support so I could win a BB-8â„¢ DROID BY SPHERO from a Camp Sponsor [BrainTree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/)

Thanks to [Steve Cooper](https://github.com/developersteve) [@DeveloperSteve](https://twitter.com/DeveloperSteve) to picking this project as the winner.

This additional game I presented might have helped too.. [I Can Haz BB-8?](https://github.com/MauriceButler/i-can-haz-bb8)
